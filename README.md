Saturday September 23 2017-My time 20 project has to do with ruby. I plan to learn ruby using ruby monk at Rubymonk.com. I also want to use  http://rubykoans.com/ to practice ruby. I plan on working with these sites to build my knowedge on ruby so I can work on a project using ruby as my end goal. I also want to learn ruby railroad. I still need to find something to make with ruby but I was thinking of making a website.

### 20Time-ICS4U WEEK 1

_ICS4U week 1 page_
Saturday September 30 2017-This was my first week of doing my times 20 project. I signed up to ruby monk using twitter(the only way that seemed to work) and started. I had to spend time creating a twitter account first, which took a bit of time.When I finally got started it was fun, but a bit challenging. It is a completely new language, so even the first bit, objectsand arguments was new and I had to get used to it. I plan to continue using ruby monk, and keep trying the puzzles. So far I havent made too much progress but I plan on making more. I also want to note that I think markdown only works on the reed me so i wont be writing a new file every week!
