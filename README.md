Saturday September 23 2017-My time 20 project has to do with ruby. I plan to learn ruby using ruby monk at Rubymonk.com. I also want to use  http://rubykoans.com/ to practice ruby. I plan on working with these sites to build my knowedge on ruby so I can work on a project using ruby as my end goal. I also want to learn ruby railroad. I still need to find something to make with ruby but I was thinking of making a website.
