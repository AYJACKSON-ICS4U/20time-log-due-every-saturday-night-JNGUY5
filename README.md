Saturday September 23 2017-My time 20 project has to do with ruby. I plan to learn ruby using ruby monk at Rubymonk.com. I also want to use  http://rubykoans.com/ to practice ruby. I plan on working with these sites to build my knowedge on ruby so I can work on a project using ruby as my end goal. I also want to learn ruby railroad. I still need to find something to make with ruby but I was thinking of making a website.

Saturday September 30 2017-This was my first week of doing my times 20 project. I signed up to ruby monk using twitter(the only way that seemed to work) and started. I had to spend time creating a twitter account first, which took a bit of time.When I finally got started it was fun, but a bit challenging. It is a completely new language, so even the first bit, objectsand arguments was new and I had to get used to it. I plan to continue using ruby monk, and keep trying the puzzles. So far I havent made too much progress but I plan on making more. I also want to note that I think markdown only works on the reed me so i wont be writing a new file every week!

### 20Time-ICS4U WEEK 2

saturday september 7 2017 -this week was my second week of ruby and it was very interesting and fun. I got to work on the same stuff, just improving and learning. It is an interesting concept, having everything being objects or having values. This is all very new to me but it is good to learn and I look forwards to continuing. I solved more challenges, but some i needed to look at the answer because I did not understand, however after I looked I understood.
