>_ICS4U starter page_
Saturday September 23 2017-My time 20 project has to do with ruby. I plan to learn ruby using ruby monk at Rubymonk.com. I also want to use  http://rubykoans.com/ to practice ruby. I plan on working with these sites to build my knowedge on ruby so I can work on a project using ruby as my end goal. I also want to learn ruby railroad. I still need to find something to make with ruby but I was thinking of making a website.

### 20Time-ICS4U WEEK 1

_ICS4U week 1 page_
Saturday September 30 2017-This was my first week of doing my times 20 project. I signed up to ruby monk using twitter(the only way that seemed to work) and started. I had to spend time creating a twitter account first, which took a bit of time.When I finally got started it was fun, but a bit challenging. It is a completely new language, so even the first bit, objectsand arguments was new and I had to get used to it. I plan to continue using ruby monk, and keep trying the puzzles. So far I havent made too much progress but I plan on making more. I also want to note that I think markdown only works on the reed me so i wont be writing a new file every week!

### 20Time-ICS4U WEEK 2

_ICS4U week 2 page_
saturday september 7 2017 -this week was my second week of ruby and it was very interesting and fun. I got to work on the same stuff, just improving and learning. It is an interesting concept, having everything being objects or having values. This is all very new to me but it is good to learn and I look forwards to continuing. I solved more challenges, but some i needed to look at the answer because I did not understand, however after I looked I understood.

### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 3

This is week 3 of my 20 time project. I was working on learning sting in ruby, and the various comands. I had to learn how to first output string, but then some more complex things. I needed to find the length, check if the string was in something, and changing cases. I did this using things like .downcase and .end_with?  and various other things.A cool thing that I learnt is that when it has a '?' at the end, it is because is has to know to indicate a boolean. So in end_with? is has a question mark because it is a yes or no answer, either it ends with the thing or not. This is unlike downcaps because .downcaps or .swapcaps because those actually change the string. The site wanted me to try and figure out myself how to do what it was asking, but it never showed the comand or what to do, so sometime i would have to get the answer from the site. I eventually picked up on the pattern of what to do, and i was able to complete the challenges.

This is just a small picture of a code calculator that I made. It was a challenge that I decided to start, to test what i learned. I also learnt a better and reliable way to put a picture in read me. You can first save your picture to your desktop or somewhere on your computer, than upload the picture to github in a seperate file. After that, you copie the link to that website, and do the same code as before and put new link in. That way it is more reliable than a random picture website, and it local on github, so idealy if someone wanted, they could just look at the photo in the file in the **_same_** repo.  Continuing about my coding, I went on to more lessons. The first one was about splitting string, and I could not figure anything out. In the picture bellow, it shows the hint String#split('') and i thought I was supposed to type the whole thing. After a long while I decided to search how to split online and I got results of just typing .split. I tried it and it was right, and I was confused. I then realized what it menat by String#split('') was that the already writen text is the string, the _#_ is the dot and i needed to only write split and what is split by.

In this picture you can see what the answer is, and how the hint was really helpfull, causing me a lot of time to be wasted



### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 5 :)
This is a bit late of a log but on purpose. Unfortunantly RubyMonk.com is not eccessable. When I try to go to the website it says that its certificate has expired and can no longer be rached because of fear of safety or somthing. I have waited a while for it to go back up, but nothing yet. I am currently looking for a new website to learn ruby on since this website will not suffice. It is a sad day but this is reality. Hopefuly my next log can be better, where ruby monk is now up or I have moved on from this website and started learning somewhere else. 

### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 6 :)

This Week I was still searching. Kept trying rubymonk but they still were down I got a few sugestions and i tried ruby koans. This site was frustrating to do because theinstructions were not clear. It wantd me to do installing using terminal. I told me to install VIM or something first, and click the link to install using termial. I put in the code for termial that it told me to do, but the first line didnt work. I didnt know what tot do s I put the second line in first and it worked but when I tried the firs ine again, it still didn't work. I just continued but the instructions were not clear.  I'm still trying.


### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 7 :)
Update ruby monk is back up. Im gonna do it for this week now. Today I tried some lesons. I was working on string commands, but more complex. For example I would be working on finsing sertain characters in a string. I wanted to do a challenge/problem instead of a lesson, however it was very complex. It said I have not learned the things yet, so I should keep doing lessons until I have the knowledge. I continued lessons and learned things like else and if. I also learned what unless does, and that ? means then and : means else . I know these will be very uefull because else and if statements are very frequent in coding and will be needed alot.


### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 8  :)
 This weak i worked on multiple things. Also the site is now working which is very good. I worked on learning stings and booleans but more advanced expressions. This was sometimes challenging because there is a lot of thinking and percision needed. Also Rubymonk is a very good site and make sure you understand, but for some of the  lessons, to get the right answer you have to do some experimenting which can be difficult. to finish the lesson off I decided to do a challenge. What the challenge wanted was for me to write an expression to narrow down a group of applicants to see who they should hire. There were specifications which were hard, but there were also specifications I had to write where it was an or statement, which added complexity. I finished the challenge after a few tries and got it working.
 Below is a photo of the code that I have coded. :smile:

### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 9  :)
This week was another fun week working on my 20time project. This week in Ruby I was learning arrays, and i realized how it was like other langages like java. I learnt how to do things like find get a specifit place of an array, and aslo create an array. Something different is that in Ruby it is a lot easier to add things or modify. Something that is different from java, and probably most languages from my knowledge, is that you ca actually cound backwards, from the end of the array. If you put a _-_ infront of the ammount you want to go back. You can see this in an immage below :eyes:

I also said its easier to change arrays because to add something to an array, you either have to put _<<_ or _.push_ 
as you can see below.

### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 10  :) :smile:
This week I aslo refined my skills of arrays in ruby, but the arrays changing I practiced were more advanced. This week I worked on transforming elements in arrays, filtering elements in arrays, and also deleting elements or parts of an array. I noticed that this can be very usefull because of how easy it is, and also this is unique from other languages. Because arrays don't have to have a set length, it is easy to delete elements of the array. I first learned transforming arrays. The code needed was the array, then .map (or .collect)then { |i| i + 1 } where i is the intiger in the array, and can be anything i beleive, and the +1 is what happens to the numbers, so it can be multipied by or divided or anything. Below is an example of transforming arrays

![arrays ruby](https://github.com/AYJACKSON-ICS4U/20time-log-due-every-saturday-night-JNGUY5/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-07%20at%2012.14.42%20AM.png)
As you can see :eyes: I multiplied everythig in the array by 3

I then worked on filtering elements. This wasn't too chalening because ruby monk gave a sample example that I could modify.  
Here is the code for one

names = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'lizard', 'spock'] 
names.select {|inty| inty.length > 5}

So you do .select and use that methose on the array,  then you create the variable for in array, and it can be anything because i cahged to _inty_ and it sill worked. Anyways you then put the conditions of what ypu want to select, so there it is variable, then the length is longer than 5 so scissors and lizard is outputed. 

After this I worked on deleting elements. Now this one was tought, not because of complexity but because it was different from the others. They did not give a sample so i had to guesse,because the hint also was deceptive. Anyways what is different is the the you do .delete instead of .select or .map, which is not too hard, but what is very different is there is no {|i| i+1} or whatever. You simply just put what you want deleted. when I think about it I guesse that might work but that is not what was the right answer. it got me just to do [1,3,5,4,6,7].delete 5 as you can maybe see better in the photo I will put underneath. 

![ruby deleting in arrays](https://github.com/AYJACKSON-ICS4U/20time-log-due-every-saturday-night-JNGUY5/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-07%20at%2012.25.16%20AM.png)

I learnt about snake casing , where you_add_enderscores_to_make_it_longer_like_this_I_hope_its_not_italycs_markdown . 
To finish this lesson off I had a challenge where I had to delete all the even numbers from the given array. After one or two tries(because i didnt read the question right) I got the correct answer and I was happy. I will put another photo below.

![ruby](https://github.com/AYJACKSON-ICS4U/20time-log-due-every-saturday-night-JNGUY5/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-07%20at%2012.32.28%20AM.png)

As you can see in the code, the condition is if divided by 2, when the remainder is 0, it will be divided. I believe in java or c++ this is called mod...  Anyways this is one of the first times I used it too but I now see why it can be usefull.

### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 10  :) :smile:

This week I still used Ruby Monk, and I was still doing arrays. This time it was more complicated. I was working on the for loos in arrays. This is tought because it isn't like arrays or loops in java, and I just got a bit confused, and also the questions were worded a bit weirdly.                    
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in array
  puts i
end

this is a simple code to output the array, and the output would be   :eyes::point_down:

1

2

3

4

5

I a also had to use for loops to add numbers to an array, which I found a bit confusing at firts. The code is below 

:point_down::point_down::point_down::point_down::point_down::point_down::point_down::point_down:

![ruby for loops array](https://github.com/AYJACKSON-ICS4U/20time-log-due-every-saturday-night-JNGUY5/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-08%20at%2010.02.17%20AM.png)

As you can see, I start the for loops for all the essentially the length of array, then for each number there is an iff statement so it appends to new array if the number is less than 4. I worked on also using each instead, and it does the same thing. So here is what the code would look like

>def array_copy(source)

>  destination = []
  
  >source.each do |number|
  
   >#Add nuber to destination if number is
   
   >#is less than4
  
  >destination << number if number < 4
   
   >end
  
  >return destination
  
 > end



and it would return 

passing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to array_copy returns [1,2,3] ✔

passing [-23, 12, 0, 19] to array_copy returns [-23, 0] ✔
