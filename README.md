Saturday September 23 2017-My time 20 project has to do with ruby. I plan to learn ruby using ruby monk at Rubymonk.com. I also want to use  http://rubykoans.com/ to practice ruby. I plan on working with these sites to build my knowedge on ruby so I can work on a project using ruby as my end goal. I also want to learn ruby railroad. I still need to find something to make with ruby but I was thinking of making a website.

### 20Time-ICS4U WEEK 1

_ICS4U week 1 page_
Saturday September 30 2017-This was my first week of doing my times 20 project. I signed up to ruby monk using twitter(the only way that seemed to work) and started. I had to spend time creating a twitter account first, which took a bit of time.When I finally got started it was fun, but a bit challenging. It is a completely new language, so even the first bit, objectsand arguments was new and I had to get used to it. I plan to continue using ruby monk, and keep trying the puzzles. So far I havent made too much progress but I plan on making more. I also want to note that I think markdown only works on the reed me so i wont be writing a new file every week!

### 20Time-ICS4U WEEK 2

_ICS4U week 2 page_
saturday september 7 2017 -this week was my second week of ruby and it was very interesting and fun. I got to work on the same stuff, just improving and learning. It is an interesting concept, having everything being objects or having values. This is all very new to me but it is good to learn and I look forwards to continuing. I solved more challenges, but some i needed to look at the answer because I did not understand, however after I looked I understood.

### 20-time-ICS4U WEEK 3

This is week 3 of my 20 time project. I was working on learning sting in ruby, and the various comands. I had to learn how to first output string, but then some more complex things. I needed to find the length, check if the string was in something, and changing cases. I did this using things like .downcase and .end_with?  and various other things.A cool thing that I learnt is that when it has a '?' at the end, it is because is has to know to indicate a boolean. So in end_with? is has a question mark because it is a yes or no answer, either it ends with the thing or not. This is unlike downcaps because .downcaps or .swapcaps because those actually change the string. The site wanted me to try and figure out myself how to do what it was asking, but it never showed the comand or what to do, so sometime i would have to get the answer from the site. I eventually picked up on the pattern of what to do, and i was able to complete the challenges.

This is just a small picture of a code calculator that I made. It was a challenge that I decided to start, to test what i learned. I also learnt a better and reliable way to put a picture in read me. You can first save your picture to your desktop or somewhere on your computer, than upload the picture to github in a seperate file. After that, you copie the link to that website, and do the same code as before and put new link in. That way it is more reliable than a random picture website, and it local on github, so idealy if someone wanted, they could just look at the photo in the file in the **_same_** repo.  Continuing about my coding, I went on to more lessons. The first one was about splitting string, and I could not figure anything out. In the picture bellow, it shows the hint String#split('') and i thought I was supposed to type the whole thing. After a long while I decided to search how to split online and I got results of just typing .split. I tried it and it was right, and I was confused. I then realized what it menat by String#split('') was that the already writen text is the string, the _#_ is the dot and i needed to only write split and what is split by.

In this picture you can see what the answer is, and how the hint was really helpfull, causing me a lot of time to be wasted



### 20-time project 
This is a bit late of a log but on purpose. Unfortunantly RubyMonk.com is not eccessable. When I try to go to the website it says that its certificate has expired and can no longer be rached because of fear of safety or somthing. I have waited a while for it to go back up, but nothing yet. I am currently looking for a new website to learn ruby on since this website will not suffice. It is a sad day but this is reality. Hopefuly my next log can be better, where ruby monk is now up or I have moved on from this website and started learning somewhere else.
