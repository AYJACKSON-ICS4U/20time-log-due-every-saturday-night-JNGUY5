## 20Time-ICS4U

_ICS4U starter page_
Saturday September 30 2017-This was my first week of doing my times 20 project. I signed up to ruby monk using twitter
(the only way that seemed to work) and started. I had to spend time creating a twitter account first, which took a bit of time.
When I finally got started it was fun, but a bit challenging. It is a completely new language, so even the first bit, objects
and arguments was new and I had to get used to it. I plan to continue using ruby monk, and keep trying the puzzles. So far I havent 
made too much progress bt i plan on making more.
